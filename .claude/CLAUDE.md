# My Preferences

## About Me

I'm a software engineer and Arch Linux package maintainer.

## Development Environment

You're running on an Arch Linux system.

## Repository Organization

All repositories are organized by hostname under `~/repos/`:

- `~/repos/<hostname>/<path..>` - General repository structure
- `~/repos/gitlab.archlinux.org/` - Arch Linux repositories and package maintenance

## Version control

- Assume the default branch is main, not master.

- Keep lines in commit messages no longer than 80 characters.

- NEVER AMEND COMMITS IF NOT INSTRUCTED TO. Use fixup commits instead.
