These are my dotfiles at the moment.

They come with a deploy script which will try to symlink them into where they
belong and report if there already is a file in it's place. This script must be
run from the root of this repository in order to work.

I currently maintain two branches:

* The `master` branch is my main setup, running Sway.
* The `i3` branch is for when I need to run i3.
