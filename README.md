These are my dotfiles at the moment.

I use these regularly on both MacOS and Arch Linux and aim for them to be
compatable with both operating systems.

Deployment can be done using my dotfile manager of choice, [dotbot][]:

    dotbot -c install.conf.yaml

I currently maintain dotfiles for both an i3 and a Sway setup since I have to
use i3 (and X11) when I'm sharing my screen.
