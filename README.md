These are my dotfiles at the moment.

I use these regularly on both MacOS and Arch Linux and aim for them to be
compatable with both operating systems.

They come with a deploy script which will try to symlink them into where they
belong and report if there already is a file in it's place. This script must be
run from the root of this repository in order to work.

I currently maintain dotfiles for both an i3 and a Sway setup since I have to
use i3 (and X11) when I sharing my screen.
